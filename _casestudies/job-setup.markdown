# Improving the Funnel Conversion on Job Setup

- Existing funnel completion was around 25%
- A lot of information needed on the first screen, wasn’t well organized
- Navigation was cumbersome, back and next coupled with next steps
- Moved to one thought per screen
- Separated navigation from “where you are”
- Funnel moved up to around 80% completion
