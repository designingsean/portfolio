## Am I an engineer or am I a designer?

This is a question that I never asked myself when I first started designing and building websites back in 1996, mainly because such a separation hadn't really been identified back then. You wanted a website? You designed it, and then you built it. This mirrored more classic software development, and so it never occurred to me that those two roles should be separate.

At the shop that I had truly started my career with, there were no designers, but I had a bit more of a talent for intuitive and visually appealing interfaces than some of my fellow developers, so interface work fell naturally to me. As I started to become versed in usability testing and basic design principles, I was also mastering the ins and out of CSS and coming to grips with javascript.

But as time passed, as web technology advanced, and most importantly as the field of "user experience" came to the forefront and design jobs were fully separated from their engineering counterparts, I eventually found myself at a bit of a crossroad when it came time to look for the next job. What am I now, and where do I want to go?

## Time to try design

So I went after and got a role as a Senior UI Designer.
