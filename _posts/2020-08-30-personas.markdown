Back in 2015, CEO Adam Robinson challenged the the VP of Product and the UX team with a simple question: Knowing what we know now about our customer and our product, what we build differently?

- Small team put in a room, began building outline of tasks different users complete
    - Identify overlap between users
    - Moment of communication between users
- From here, developed identities of these users.
- Oversaw research on their wants and needs as it related to Hireology
    - In addition, validated assumptions of work flows and structure between personas
- Shared with the company
    - Adopted by leadership as a common framework to refer to not just existing users but prospects as well
    - Passed on to Marketing to add buyer persona information for Sales to use more effectively.
- Currently plan on revisiting, using them as framework to break tasks into “hats” a particular user wears, and the overlap that “hat” has with other personas
