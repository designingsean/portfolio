Back in the fall of 2015, Hireology CEO Adam Robinson challenged the VP of Product and the UX team with a simple question: Knowing what we know now about our customer and how they use the product, what we build differently?

So the UX team flew to Chicago, got together in a small room with our Product VP at the local tech incubator, and set to work figuring out who are existing users were and what they were doing.

Over the course of several hours, we were able to map out four main users, the tasks they wanted to accomplish, and the moments where these individual users may want to be able to communicate with each other.

- Small team put in a room, began building outline of tasks different users complete
    - Identify overlap between users
    - Moment of communication between users
- From here, developed identities of these users.
- Oversaw research on their wants and needs as it related to Hireology
    - In addition, validated assumptions of work flows and structure between personas
- Shared with the company
    - Adopted by leadership as a common framework to refer to not just existing users but prospects as well
    - Passed on to Marketing to add buyer persona information for Sales to use more effectively.
- Currently plan on revisiting, using them as framework to break tasks into “hats” a particular user wears, and the overlap that “hat” has with other personas
