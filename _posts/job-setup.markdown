## Background

In September of 2018, we set out to improve the multi-form process for creating a job in the Hireology application. Who is &ldquo;we&rdquo;, you ask? After hiring Jess, Hireology's first Associate UX Designer (then called Junior UX Designer), she and I worked together to craft this solution.

The project was straight forward enough for her first assignment without having to understand the ins and outs of the entire application. It was also something I had been wanting to rework for a while, so I was able to provide the requirements and overarching goals that needed to be accomplished.

## Problem

The issue we were seeing was that only about 20 to 25% of users who started opening a job would get all the way through the process without dropping off along the way. By and large, they would fall off in the first few steps, which were about providing details about the job and the job&rsquo;s description.

The first page in particular was packed with various information that we needed to open a job. However, the organization of that information was a mess. Essentially, we were trying to do too much with one screen.

In addition, the navigation was anchored at the bottom and took up nearly 1/5 of the page. Coupled with the header, it left very little real estate for users to be able to see much less understand what the process required.

## Solution

Let&rsquo;s work backwards on this one. The first issue that needed to be resolved is the navigation using less screen area. At the same time, we wanted it to be a bit more clear as to how many steps were involved and what was required on each.

By looking at existing checkout patterns, we were able to create a navigation that was more effective while taking up significantly less room on the page. We also separated the &ldquo;Back&rdquo; and &ldquo;Next&rdquo; buttons from the navigation, allowing them to continue to live at the bottom of each page.

The second and bigger issue was that there was just too much being asked for on the initial screens. To solve this, we approached it with the "One Thing Per Page" approach, reasoning that people would be more willing to complete more pages if they were shorter and more organized.

## Results

We rolled this feature out slowly, launching it with selected existing customers to track performance and identify bugs before a larger release. After 30 days, we saw those customers go from around a 25% completion rate to over 70%.

To be honest, we were stunned by this result. I assumed there would be a lift in the conversion, but certainly nothing at this scale. I double and triple checked how the elements were set up in our analytics suite to be sure we were tracking appropriately.

In the end, everything was correct. We rolled out the improvements to our entire customer base, and saw the funnel complete even higher, settling in at over 80%.

What is interesting is that the overall number of open jobs has not increased by the same rate. It has gone up for certain, but not by the amount that it should have by improving a funnel conversion rate by more than 70 points. Based on my analysis, I believe what we are seeing is more users being able to complete the funnel without quitting and coming back to it later.

While I do not have any numbers to back it up, I believe that had we been able to measure user satisfaction of this feature before and after the change, we would have seen a positive shift in numbers.

## Summary

Simple changes can have a huge positive impact. It can be tough to believe if you are not in the user experience field. It can sometimes be easy to forget if you are.
